Claim Processing Assistant in Healthcare

Overview

  The Claim Processing Assistant is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict healthcare claim outcomes (approval or rejection) and claim amounts based on patient data. The       project leverages machine learning models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the claim approval process.
  
  The system uses several features like age, gender, BMI, hereditary diseases, job title, smoker status, etc., to predict the likelihood of a claim being approved or rejected, as well as the        expected claim amount. This project is deployed on Azure with a user-friendly front end to interact with the model and view the predictions.
